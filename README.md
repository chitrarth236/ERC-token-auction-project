# ERC-token-auction-project
Ethereum Based Sealed Bid Auction for ERC20 Tokens


In this paper, we proposed an implementation of Sealed Envelope Auction uding Ethereum Smart Con-
tracts. Ethereum being very 
exible and scalable blockchain reserves plenty of advantages for
these types of applications under smart contracts.
Smart Contracts are immutable, transaparent and self-
verifiable, thus provides security, trust and dynamicity
to the applications.
